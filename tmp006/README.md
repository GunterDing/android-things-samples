TMP006 Thermopile sample for Android Things using UPM
-----------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates a I2C TMP006 connection using UPM.

build.gradle:

   ````
   dependencies {
       compile 'io.mraa.at.upm:upm_tmp006:1.+'
       compile 'io.mraa.at:mraa:1.+'
       provided 'com.google.android.things:androidthings:0.4-devpreview'
   }
   ````

Java:
````
thermopile = new upm_tmp006.TMP006(i2cIndex, (short) 0, 64);
thermopile.setActive();
Log.i(TAG,"Temperature: "+ thermopile.getTemperature(1) + " Â°C");
thermopile.delete();

````


Pre-Requisites:
---------------
Use of the Grove Kit (for Joule or Edison) makes this easy. See the following links for getting
a starter kit.

*  https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Maker-Kit-for-Intel-Joule-p-2796.html
*  https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Starter-Kit-V3-p-1855.html

You will need:

1. Android Things compatible board.
2. Grove header or Breakout board.
3. A TMP006 breakout.


Build and install:
------------------

On Android Studio, select the "tmp006" module in select box by the "Run" button
and then click on the "Run" button.


Changing the I2C bus
--------------------


The I2C bus to be used is specified in the strings.xml file (src/res/values directory).

````
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">TMP006</string>

    <string name="Tmp_Edison_Arduino">I2C6</string>
    <string name="Tmp_Edison_Sparkfun">I2C1</string>
    <string name="Tmp_Joule_Tuchuck">I2C0</string>
</resources>
````


The code will automatically determine the board type being run on (modify BoarDefaults.java) and select a string from this file for the I2C bus.
The above example uses I2C6 on the Edison Arduino shield and I2C0 on the Joule Tuchuck
development board. These strings are programmed into the Peripheral Manager and read from their
into the UPM library to determine the bus to be used.

See the top level README.md for a table describing the available I2C busses and where to find them
on the board.
